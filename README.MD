# OpenGL study

Simple OpenGL study for learning the basics and to start to access and manipulate 3D realtime graphics.

The first step was to start and learn how to create a very simple windows and how to connect the OpenGL implementation with it.

All of this using Visual Studio (because is simple for learning, even though the overall project is a bit messy).

## Next Steps

Create a CMake version of this repo, with the project properly organized and structured, and with a multiplatform implementation of all the OpenGL code (that, right now, works only on Windows).
